1. Introduction

This PRD outlines the requirements for implementing the ColorChoose feature on our e-commerce platform, aimed at enhancing user experience by enabling customers to filter products by color. This feature will streamline product discovery and selection for our users, particularly those seeking merchandise in specific colorways.
2. Objective

To introduce the ColorChoose feature, which will allow users to filter products based on color, improving the efficiency of the shopping experience and potentially increasing conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
3. Background

Feedback from customer surveys and analytics data have shown that a significant portion of our user base shops for fashion items with specific colors in mind. Currently, users must manually browse through product listings or use text-based search queries, which may not always yield accurate results. Implementing a dedicated color filter feature addresses this gap.
4. Feature Description

The ColorChoose feature will enable users to filter products by color through a visual interface integrated into existing filter options on category, search results, and recommendations pages. Users will select from a palette of predefined colors, with the option to choose multiple colors for a single query.
5. User Stories

    As a shopper, I want to filter products by color so that I can quickly find items matching my desired color scheme.

6. Functional Requirements

    FR1: The system shall display a color palette in the filter options section on category, search results, and recommendations pages.
    FR2: Users must be able to select one or multiple colors from the palette to apply as filters.
    FR3: The product listing shall update in real-time to display only products that match the selected color filters.
    FR4: Each product’s color metadata must be accurately tagged to ensure correct filtering.
    FR5: Users shall have the option to clear selected color filters easily.

7. Non-Functional Requirements

    NFR1: Color filter updates shall reflect in under 2 seconds upon selection.
    NFR2: The feature must support over 10,000 concurrent users without degradation in performance.
    NFR3: The color palette UI shall be accessible, adhering to WCAG 2.1 standards for color contrast and navigability.

8. Dependencies

    Dependency on the product information management system for accurate color metadata tagging of products.

9. Assumptions and Constraints

    Assumes accurate color metadata is available for all products.
    The feature’s effectiveness is constrained by the accuracy of color representation in product images.

10. Acceptance Criteria

    AC1: Given a user on the product listing page, when they select one or more colors from the ColorChoose palette, then the product listings shall update to show only those matching the selected colors.
    AC2: Given a user has applied color filters, when they choose to clear the filters, then the product listings shall revert to showing all products.

11. Analytics and Reporting

    Track usage frequency of the ColorChoose feature.
    Monitor conversion rate changes for users who utilize color filtering.
    Report on the most frequently selected colors.

12. Mockups and Diagrams
